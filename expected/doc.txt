 Tutorials. There are 4 tutorials of increasing complexity currently included in this document: The Basic Tutorial (4) shows how to make a simple static gamebook for printing or reading on a screen. The Advanced Tutorial (5) adds many formatting tricks to make more interesting gamebooks, but still only very static. The Dynamic Tutorial (6) finally explains how to add mark-up to your gamebooks to be make dynamic HTML gamebooks that can be played in a browser (while still work well if it is printed on paper or viewed in a simple ebook reader). Finally The Customization Tutorial (7) shows how to override the default templates to make small or big changes to how gamebooks are rendered. The tutorials do not cover all features of gamebookformat, so also have a look at the included examples and the Reference section below (8) to learn about all the things the tools can do.
