    Paged Option

Introduction
 This gamebook is formatted with the paged option. Every section should begin at the top of a new page. Not the introsections though. 

Another Heading
 This is another introsection, just to confirm that it is not cause a new page-break. 

Formats
 Only some formats support page-breaks. HTML for instance currently does not (although it is technically possible to add it using print stylesheets). 


Turn to 1 to begin.
1
 First section. You can go to 4 or 3 from here. 

2
 This is The End. 

3
 This is the third section. It might or might not be numbered 3 though, because of the automatic section numbering in gamebookformat. You can go on to the end at 2. 

4
 This is the second section. Yay. You can go on to 3 or 2 or back to 1.
