## Introduction ##
 For information that goes before the actual numbered sections, if needed. 

## More Introduction ##
  Any number of these optional pre-game sections are possible really. It would be useful to be able to do sub-sections here to mark up a complete rulebook as part of the paragraph booklet, but there is no such feature (yet?). 

Turn to 1 to begin.
<a name="section1">

## 1 ##
 This is the first section (or paragraph, if you prefer). From here you can go to section [4](#section4)
 or [3](#section3)
. 
<a name="section2">

## 2 ##
 This is the end. There is nothing more in this gamebook.
<a name="section3">

## 3 ##
 Third section. Again, its number is not known. You can go to the end at [2](#section2)
. This section has an image to show the syntax for doing that (same as images in bgg forums really). ![](testimage.png)
 
<a name="section4">

## 4 ##
 This is the second section. It may or may not end up with number 2 in the generated gamebook. From here you can skip to the [2](#section2)
 or go to the third section at [3](#section3)
.
