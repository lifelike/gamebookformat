## Introduction ##
 This gamebook demonstrates simple references between sections. Also notice that an intro section like this one can reference sections, like the start at [1](#section1)
 or the next section at [400](#section400)
. References can include an optional name that is used in some formats, so the same links could also be rendered as [start](#section1)
 and [next](#section400)
.
