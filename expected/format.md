# Format #


## Introduction ##
 Adding an introduction to the gamebook here. This will create a section, but it will not be shuffled nor numbered with the gamebook sections below. 

## Another Heading ##
 This starts another non-shuffled section. (A footnote in Another Heading.)
 

Adventure begins in section 1.
<a name="section1">

 This examples tests gamebook formatting, not so much game mechanics or references. Currently there is nothing here really. This section contains some tricky characters to quote, like \} and \{ and " and ' and \\. HTML will probably not like <div> or &boom;. You can make named references [like this](#section6)
 (just happens to be exactly the same syntax as in emacs org-mode btw). This book also includes a [format-specific section](#section4)
. There should be an image below as well. If something broke, turn to [2](#section2)
, otherwise turn to [3](#section3)
.(Good footnote.)

<a name="section2">

## 2 ##
 Bad.
<a name="section3">

## 3 ##
 Good! 
<a name="section4">

## 4 ##
 This is the format-specific section for no other formats. Now you [lose](#section2)
. 
<a name="section5">

## 5 ##
 Very good. [You win](#section3)
.(Win footnote.)
 
<a name="section6">

## 6 ##
 This is where you should end up when you follow the named reference from the starting section. From here you can go to [the second named section](#section5)
 or to the [good end](#section3)
.
